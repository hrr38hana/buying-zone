# Buying Zone

> Where purchasing is made easy

Discovering all the features, info, and technology of a product is great, but what about when it
comes time to purchase? The buying zone makes purchasing easy by summarizing a product's name,
average ratings, and a brief description, and by allowing any desired options to be selected before
making it yours with just the click of a button.

## Developing

Setting Buying Zone up for development is quick and easy!

First, be sure to have [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) (@ version 4+) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (@ version 9+) installed. Next, fork the repository, and
on your development machine run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-path>/buying-zone.git
cd buying-zone/
npm install
```

Running Buying Zone for development requires at least two open terminals:

### First terminal:
```
npm run build:dev
```
- Compiles the project using webpack in development mode. The `--watch` flag is set so changes are
automatically re-compiled

### Second terminal:
```
npm run server:dev
```
- Starts a local server listening at port 3001. Uses `nodemon` to restart the server upon changes to
files
- Visit http://localhost:3001/ to see the app running in the browser

### Additional development options:

#### Seeding the database

```
npm run seed
```

- Seeds the database by running `/database/seed.js`

#### Manual database queries

- Ensure MongoDB is running
- From within the `mongo` shell, run `use trekbikes`, then query the database as desired

See [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/) for more detailed information on running
MongoDB and the `mongo` shell

#### Testing

```
npm test
```
- Checks all `.js` and `.jsx` files against Airbnb style guide using ESLint
- Runs all test suites
